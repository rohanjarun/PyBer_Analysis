# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
This project "PyBer" is like uber but a python based ride sharing company. We needed to analyze the ride sharing data and understand important fields such as the total rides/drivers/fare along with the average fare they pay for each ride. This project specializes in the early months of 2019 and help the board at Pyber make decisions with regards to how they want to grow their company.

## Resources used
The datasets used in this project were 
* [city data csv file](/Resources/city_data.csv)
* [ride data csv file](/Resources/ride_data.csv)
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* VS Code

## Results and Conclusion
After analyzing the information, a conclusion can be drawn that urban cities have the largest number of rides. The number of drivers are also far greater in Urban cities compared to the other two. Urban cities make around 60% of the total fares collected which means that Pyber should look towards focusing on other urban cities as opposed to investing in suburban or rural areas.
